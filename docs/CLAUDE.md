# Scope: docs/ (Project docs + plans)

## Applies to
- This file governs work inside `docs/**` only.
- Global SSOT remains `../CLAUDE.md`.

## Focus
- Plans, operational docs, checklists, Context7 baseline usage notes.

## Guardrails
- Docs-only changes must not modify code.
- If a doc references commands/scripts, verify against `package.json` before writing.

## Gates
- None required beyond basic sanity check; do not run heavy gates for docs-only edits.
